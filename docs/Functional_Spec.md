# Use Case
### Middle School Student
```
Student walks up to game.
They have the option of watching the idle video explaining information on malaria or skipping straight to the game.
After they finish or skip the video they scan a barcode to start the game.
They are told which scenario the barcode initiated.
A screen asks them what they want to treat with first. 
As they make choices, information on these choices is read and displayed.
They make 2 choices and either get a "try again" screen (Then repeat from start) or move on to the next section. 
An animation plays on the map and they see the effect of their choices.
Videos that explain the impact of their choices play.
If they do not get a "Try Again" screen, they get to play mini games based on the tools they used.
Then they are given a screen with long term choices.
These choices are explained and their effects shown in the same way as the first choices.
Map and video effects are shown... etc.
they get to play mini games based on the tools they used.
Scoreboard shows.
Kick to idle.
