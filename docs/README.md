## Welcome to Comp523 Project - Stop the Outbreak 
This is a game designed for the Moorehead Planetarium with the goal of spreading awareness about one of the worlds most deadly diseases, Malaria.

# Concept
The basic machanic of this game is to provide the player with a fixed budget, as teams are constrained by in the real world with which to fight the outbreak. Then they are presented with a malaria outbreak of a certain "type". The player is then asked to invest their money into a number of tools in any order they wish. After each tool is selected, a cutscene will play to demonstrate the effect the player's decision had on the outbreak, which will also be reflected in the players "score". After all the tools or money have been used up, the player will be presented with a visual representing their progress in stopping the infection.

The interface for the game is a touchscreen where we will display all the buttons and tools. There will also be an overhead projector that will display a map that shows the area that has been infected. Above the touch screen will be a second larger screen, where the cutscenes and the information we want to share with the players will be displayed.
