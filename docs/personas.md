### User Story 1 (Bradley and James)
```
Bradley and James are best friends. They always compete with each other. 
As they watch someone else play STO, Bradley realizes that it includes a scoreboard at the end. 
Eager to see who does the best, Bradley challenges James. 
Bradley usually tries more trial and error than James, and ends up failing the first round. 
Hit with a "try again" screen, Bradley focuses more this round and completes the game with a decent score. 
James finishes the game after with a slightly higher score and they both leave the game impressed with a close match-up.

She knows this will interest and draw in her students. 
She decides to take her students one day because she is impressed with the resources of the Morehead Science Center.

### User Story 3 (Thomas)

Thomas sees someone else playing STO. 
He ponders how many choices are actually available to the player and wants to see if the game is replayable. 
He starts by choosing obvious wrong choices to see what happens. 
The whole map lights up red and he gets a "try" again screen. 
Intrigued by the interaction he spends 30 minutes trying every decision. 
He ends up at the the top of the leaderboard, just before he leaves with his group and is pleased with his result.

### User Story 4 (Bob)
```
Bob watches the idle video for a while before starting the game. 
Unlike his other peers, he seems to be drawn in by the information more than the game. 
He takes a full five minutes to play through the game, carefully reading each decision and the information with each choice. 
He chuckles at some of the bad choices, but ultimately picks the perfect options the first time around. 
He is pleased with his result and goes on the other exhibits.
