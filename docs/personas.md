Thomas and James are best friends. They always compete with each other. 
As they watch someone else play STO, they realize that it includes a scoreboard at the end. 
Eager to see who does the best, they both run through the game. 
James usually tries more trial and error than Thomas, and ends up failing the first round. 
Hit with a "try again" screen, Thomas focuses more this round and completes the game with a decent score. 
Thomas finishes the game after with a slightly higher score and they both leave the game impressed with a close match-up.

Hannah is a teacher judging the learning value of the game. 
She jumps in and quickly tries various combinations of choices. 
She likes the amount of information which is displayed and read along with small bits of text on the screen. 
It makes it easier to digest and she knows that the kids will learn more from it. 
She also likes that the visual map representation shows information while also looking really interesting.
She knows this will interest and draw in her students.
She decides to take her students one day because she is impressed with the resources of the Morehead Science Center.
